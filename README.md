## 🧠 INTELLIGENCE LAYER | AI-POWERED COGNITIVE PROTOCOL

### 🤖 The AI Analyst Contract
RepoAnalyst delivers high-fidelity, layered reasoning. Every interpretation follows a specific protocol to ensure technical depth without generic AI fluff.
* **Insight Summary**: High-signal, 1-sentence analytical statements derived from aggregate data vectors.
* **Structural Context**: Deep-dive explanations grounding the insight in your actual code topology.
* **Forward Signal**: Predictive indicators highlighting future maintenance or reliability risks.

### 🧩 Specialized Analytical Domains
Our AI engine implements section-specific focus themes across the entire analysis pipeline:
* **Systemic Patterns**: Detecting alignment or imbalance in overall development activity.
* **Structural Stability**: Mapping coupling, entropy, and architectural fragility.
* **Risk Trajectory**: Predicting direction and momentum of technical debt inflection points.
* **Blast Radius**: Calculating amplification and containment of modular changes.
* **Exposure Volatility**: Monitoring supply-chain pressure and dependency churn.
* **Knowledge Redundancy**: Identifying bus-factor fragility and cognitive silos.
* **Temporal Churn**: Detecting recurrence and unresolved motion in high-frequency zones.

### ⚡ Cognitive Layer Protocol
The integrated "Cognitive Layer" transforms raw metrics into an intentional narrative.
* **Designed Narrative**: Implicit UI integration removes raw metric labels for a professional SaaS dashboard experience.
* **Thematic Precision**: Language tailored specifically to the engineering domain (e.g., "blast radius", "structural entropy").
* **Confident Synthesis**: Tone is professional, decisive, and restrained—optimized for elite engineering leaders.
