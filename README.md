## 🌌 UNLEASH YOUR ENGINEERING SUPERPOWERS

### 🛰️ REVOLUTIONARY TOPOLOGY INTELLIGENCE
Witness your repository as a living breathing ecosystem. Our clustering algorithm maps every directory into logical modules plus calculates structural entropy in real time.
* Interactive physics based node mapping.
* Automated directory evolution sensing.
* Instant module health scoring.

---

### 📉 STRATEGIC RISK TRAJECTORY PLOTTING
Predict system failure before it happens. We analyze code churn plus commit velocity to plot your system health across the entire timeline of the project.
* Weekly health snapshots with precision.
* Historical stability trend identification.
* Churn vs Velocity correlation mapping.

---

### ☢️ GLOBAL BLAST RADIUS ANALYSIS
Calculate the lethal zone of a single modification. By mapping deep transitive dependency chains RiskSurface shows you the ripple effects before you even open a pull request.
* Transitive dependency discovery logic.
* Module fragility percentage metrics.
* Transitory risk identification patterns.

---

### 🎯 CHANGE CONCENTRATION RADAR
Identify the files that are bleeding your engineering resources dry. We pinpoint the twenty percent of code causing eighty percent of your stability issues.
* File churn performance ranking.
* Effort distribution heatmap visualizer.
* Refactor target prioritization logic.

---

### 💎 PRECISION TEMPORAL HOTSPOT DETECTION
Detect high intensity zones where code is changing too fast to remain stable. These spots are prime candidates for bugs plus regressions.
* Point of interest timestamp mapping.
* Commit density pressure alerts.
* Stability burst classification engine.

## 🏛️ THE BLUEPRINT | INTERNAL SYSTEMS MAPPING

### ⚔️ FRONTEND STACK | REACT PRECISION
The interface delivers a premium glassmorphic experience spanning every single pixel, now fully responsive.
* `src/App.tsx` : The central orchestrator with integrated routing.
* `src/components/ProjectContextHeader.tsx` : Unified project identity across all views.
* `src/components/RealDashboard.tsx` : Tactical overview with live health metrics.
* `src/components/RealTopology.tsx` : Architectural entropy and module mapping.
* `src/components/RealTrajectory.tsx` : Stability velocity and risk direction.
* `src/components/RealImpact.tsx` : Dependency-weighted blast radius analysis.
* `src/components/RealDependencies.tsx` : Real-time manifest import extraction.
* `src/components/RealConcentration.tsx` : Bus factor and ownership risk index.
* `src/components/RealTemporal.tsx` : High-velocity commit hotspot detection.
* `src/components/ConnectionPage.tsx` : Centralized repository analysis portal.
* `src/components/GitHubConnectModal.tsx` : Secure OAuth/PAT credential gateway.

### ⚙️ BACKEND CORE | GO PERFORMANCE
Our backend is a high performance engine designed for real-time analysis of multi-GB repositories.
* `server/main.go` : The core analyzer engine with parallel AST parsing.
* `server/state.json` : Persistent vault for repository metadata and analysis cycles.
* **REST API** : Unified endpoints for `/api/analysis/*` delivering granular architectural signals.

## 📱 VISUAL INTEGRITY | RESPONSIVE FIRST
RiskSurface is engineered for tactical deployment on any device.
* **Mobile-Optimized Layouts**: Bespoke CSS architecture ensuring zero overflow on narrow viewports.
* **Intelligent Truncation**: Precision font scaling and truncation for deep file systems.
* **Touch-Ready Controls**: High-fidelity interactions optimized for mobile and desktop parity.

## 🛠️ THE WAR ROOM SETUP | INSTALLATION PROTOCOL

Follow this specific sequence to deploy the platform on your station:

### 1. ARMED THE PREREQUISITES
Verify these specific versions inhabit your machine:
* Go SDK 1.21 plus superior.
* Node runtime 18 plus superior.
* GitHub Personal Access Token for deep account scans.

### 2. INITIALIZE THE CORE ENGINE
1. Clone this repository to your local workstation.
2. In the root directory execute `npm install`.
3. In the `server` directory execute `go mod tidy`.

---

## ⚡ MISSION OPERATIONS | EXECUTION STEPS

### STEP ALPHA | IGNITE THE ANALYZER
Open your terminal in the `server` folder plus execute:
`go run main.go`
The target engine will roar to life on port 8080.

### STEP BETA | DEPLOY THE VISUALIZER
Open another terminal in the root plus execute:
`npm run dev`
Access the command center via `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🛡️ THE FORTRESS | TOTAL PRIVACY SOVEREIGNTY

We treat your intellectual property with absolute respect. RiskSurface is built on a philosophy of total containment.
* ZERO CLOUD STORAGE : All data stays local in your `state.json`.
* VOLATILE CREDENTIALS : GitHub keys are held in memory only plus vanish immediately.
* LOCAL SOVEREIGNTY : No tracking plus no telemetry plus zero external calls.
